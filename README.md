# JavaClassProjs

4/1/18  Refactored some code in List.jsp to remove the scriptlets from the jsp.
        At this point the project is not fully functional so I am not pushing it 
        to the repo, but I want to have a record of something for the #100DaysOfCode
        Challenge.

4/3/18  Started iplementing some of the changes Oz recomended, but not far enough 
        along to push new code. Still A LOT to do.

4/5/18  Started breaking out my DAOs from my service layer and adding some interfaces
        to code the project to. This is going to be a lot of rework so I am not going
        to push new code just yet.

4/7/18  Kept working on the DAOs and Service Layer, once I finish tying them together, 
        I will push the new code. 

4/8/18  Introduced a new person to HTML/CSS at FreeCodeCamp meetup. Also spent some 
        time on the MeetingRoomScheduler. I removed the old service layer and have
        no errors. I still need to finish putting in the code to make the MVC work.

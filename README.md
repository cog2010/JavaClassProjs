# JavaClassProjs

4/1/18  Refactored some code in List.jsp to remove the scriptlets from the jsp.
        At this point the project is not fully functional so I am not pushing it 
        to the repo, but I want to have a record of something for the #100DaysOfCode
        Challenge.

4/3/18  Started iplementing some of the changes Oz recomended, but not far enough 
        along to push new code. Still A LOT to do.
